# AdvancementPack

AdvancementPack allows you to unlock Java Edition advancements in your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition world. A faithful re-creation of the Java UI makes this Add-On unique, and fully supports multiplayer. This can also be used in conjunction with other Add-Ons, given that it does not utilize `player.json`.
